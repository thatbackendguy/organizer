## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

1. Place the executable in the folder with your image files.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in that folder.
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
      ./v1.0-io-linux-x64     # Or the relevant binary for your OS
   ```
4. You will be prompted to:
  * Choose between Preview (1) or Organize (2)
  * Enter a starting year (e.g., 2000)
  * Confirm the operation (for Organize mode)

## üìÇ What It Does
* Detects years in filenames using many formats (e.g. IMG_20230404_223211.jpg, 2020-01-01.png, BURST20191212, etc.)
* Organizes images into folders named after the detected years:
  ```text
  2020/
    IMG20201212.jpg
  2021/
    photo20210101.png
  Extra/
    random_image.png
  ```
## üß™ Example Session
```text
Choose option:
1. Preview organization (recommended first)
2. Organize files
Enter choice (1 or 2): 1

Enter starting year (e.g., 2000, default is 1900): 2010
